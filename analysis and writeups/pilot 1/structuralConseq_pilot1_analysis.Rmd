## Material

## Procedure

## Data analysis
We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses. 

Participants were excluded for failing the attention checks.
<!-- data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. Key analysis of interest. Can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.-->

For the target of intervention question, explanations will be coded into "Internal", "Structural", or "Other" by individuals blind to the research hypothesis. For the purposes of this pilot with adults, explanations will be coded by the experimenter without knowledge of each participant's condition. A fuller coding scheme will be developed before actual testing, but:

- modify Zarpies biology (vaccine, potion, pill, medicine, build tolerance, cross-breed with another alien)
- modify Zarpies beliefs/culture (tell them it's not bad luck, tell them it's good luck, change their thoughts)
- modify okinberries themselves so they are safe to eat (change color, wash them, heat up, cook them, prepare them, remove part, mix with something else, sanitize)
- acquire pogoberries
- acquire okinberries (grow/plant, import, trade, ask Vawns to send, search planet, tell them where to find, share with Vawns, travel, visit Vawns, move to other side of planet, switch spots with Vawns)
- I don't know
- ambiguous (do a magic spell that allows them to eat okinberries, give seeds, ask someone for them, be friendly with others, make it to where the okinberries don't make the Zarpies sick, have it not be poisonous, Will harvest again and cultivate it, establish hospitals for Zarpies when they get sick)
- other (Zarpies will try to eat okinberies, too far away)



- "Internal" = explanations appealing to causes located inside of an individual category member (eg genes, mental states) or inside of the group as a whole (eg culture, shared knowledge)
- "Structural" = explanations appealing to causes located external to the group that operate on the group as a whole (eg location)
- "Other" = idiosyncratic, non-answers, or explanations that appeal to external factors that do not apply to the group as a whole
