What can aliens eat?

Why are there differences between groups of people? For example, why do different social groups eat different kinds of foods? We can imagine this might be because of some underlying biological, cultural, or structural cause. Importantly, what we take to be the underlying cause may lead us to different ideas about how members of a group behave and should behave. In this study, children learn about groups of aliens who eat different kinds of berries. We give children different reasons why a group eats a certain type of food, and see how that shifts their attitudes about what the aliens eat and should eat. This study can help us understand the importance of how we think about the causes of group differences from an early age.
